# Sass-Documentation-and-Style-Guide

### Setup

Download and Install: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebCompiler

The configuration file is already set as compilerconfig.json. It will take the input in the Sass folder and compile into the output file located in the css folder. If you modify the output css file all your changes will be deleted when Sass is recompiled.

### Naming

* Dashes instead of camelCase!
  ```scss 
  //bad
  .camelCaseCssIsCluttered {}
  
  //good
  .dashes-are-readable {}
  
  /* Most of the typos currently are due to camel case being hard to read. */ 
  ```

* Dashes instead of underscores!

  ```scss
  //bad
  .this_requires_more_keystrokes {}
  
  //good
  .this-is-faster {}
  
  /* Start to override Kendo UI's autogenerated ID's. Let's keep that dependency under control. */
  ```

* Semantic & feature related naming

  ```scss
  //not good
  .form {} 
  #logo {}
  .errorBody {}
  
  /* What form/logo? What does this selector affect? 
  Unless this is the ONLY header in the entire application, be specific. */

  //better
  #registration-form {}
  #main-navbar-logo {}
  .order-validation-error {}
  
  /* If an element is going to be reused THEN find a more flexible name and reorganize accordingly. */
  ```
  ```scss
  //boo
  .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a {}

  /* It's unnecessarily long and should be easier to follow. 
     Keep children selectors limited to 2.
    If you're feeling fancy 3 at the most BUT make sure 
    that the parent and the root of the selector is reliably named. */

  //yay!
  .main-navbar-link {}
  
  /* Also this is better for searchability. Too many children makes it really difficult to know
  whats affecting which elements. */ 
    
  ```
  ```scss
  
  //meh
  #welcomeBody, .efmErrorBody, .errorBody, .paragraphBody {}
  
  /* If identical styles are being used with 3 or more different names it means 
  they are a component. Components are good. Take care of the dependency. */
  
  //hooray
  .message-page-paragraph {}
  
  /* All those selectors belong to pages where that <p> tag is the main content
  (i.e. successful registration page, password reset page, error page)
  a good way to handle would be to unify and categorize all those pages as message pages */ 
 
  /* Also notice how non descriptive ".paragraphBody" is. */
  ```

### File Structure 

* We will be working from the /sass folder. 
* /sass has the "main.scss" file in which other partials are imported using ```@import './file/path';```
* main.scss is the input file that is configured in compilerconfig.json
* The order of those imports is important so do not modify it. 
* There are two main folders inside /sass. 
  * /sass/modules - Reusable Sass specific functionalities that imported to main.scss before everything else. 
  * /sass/partials - Where our custom styles live. 
* /modules contains files -> colors.scss & mixins.scss. 
  * colors.scss - contains all the Sass color variables that should be used in other partials.
  * mixins.scss - contains all the Sass functions that get executed and filled in at compile time. 
* /partials - contains 2 folders & component files. 
  * Note: When one of the styles in these folders is going to be used more often we need to make it into a component file.
  * /shared - Styles belonging exclusively to a specific html file under /Views/Shared. Named the same. 
  * /views - Styles belonging exclusively to an html file under /Views. Named the same.  
  * Component Files - buttons.scss, links.scss, content-panel.scss. (This is our goal.) 
  
### Sass - What we can do now! 

* &:hover, &:active, &:focus 
```scss
//OLD WAY
.we-have-this-long-selector, .oh-and-this-one-as-well {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: $primary;
}

.we-have-this-long-selector:hover, 
.oh-and-this-one-as-well:hover, {
  background-color: $primary;
  color: $white75;
}

//NEW WAY
.we-have-this-long-selector, .oh-and-this-one-as-well {
  background-color: $white75;
  color: $primary;
  
  &:hover { 
    background-color:$primary;
    color: $white75;
  }
  
  &:focus {
    background-color: $light-primary; 
    color: $white;
  }
}

/* It will be taken care of when it compiles. Thanks Sass! More maintainable! */ 
```
* Media tag mixins

```scss

//THE GOODS

//max-width media tag mixin
@mixin max($size) {
    @if $size == xs {
        @media screen and (max-width: 330px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == sm {
        @media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == md {
        @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == lg {
        @media screen and (max-width: 1200px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
}

//min-width media tag mixin
@mixin min($size) {
    @if $size == xs {
        @media screen and (min-width: 330px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == sm {
        @media screen and (min-width: 576px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == md {
        @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == lg {
        @media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
    @else if $size == xl {
        @media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
            @content;
        }
    }
}
```
```scss

//How to use the media tags!

.some-class {
  width: 50%; 
  
  @include max(md) {
    width: 75%;
  }
  
  @include max(xs) {
    width: 100%; 
  }
}

.some-other-class {
  width: 100%; 
  
  @include min(sm) {
    width: 75%; 
  }
  
  @include min(lg) {
    width: 50%; 
  }
}

/* Would like to move in a direction where we don't combine min and max for the same element. 
  Being that we are not mobile first, using max makes more sense. Regardless, there is min legacy so we need it. */ 
```

#### What does this mean? 

Media tags that do not lie inside 

* Cross browser compatibility mixin
```scss 

/* $exclude is an optional parameter, used for properties like "transition" in which -ms- is not valid */ 

@mixin browsers($property, $value, $exclude:"") {
    @if $exclude != webkit {
        -webkit-#{$property}: $value;
    }

    @if $exclude != moz {
        -moz-#{$property}: $value;
    }

    @if $exclude != ms {
        -ms-#{$property}: $value;
    }

    @if $exclude != o {
        -o-#{$property}: $value;
    }
    
    #{$property}: $value;
}
```
```scss
.spinner .rect2 {
    @include browsers(animation-delay, -1.1s, ms);
}

COMPILES TO...

.spinner .rect2 {
  -webkit-animation-delay: -1.1s;
  -moz-animation-delay: -1.1s;
  -o-animation-delay: -1.1s;
  animation-delay: -1.1s; 
}

```
